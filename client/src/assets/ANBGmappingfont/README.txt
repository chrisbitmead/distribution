*.vfc seems to be the native file format of FontLab software
I'm putting ANBG-font.vfc here in case, but no matter
what software you use, you should be fine using the 
ANBG-font-COLR.ttf as your input file. This font is a 
COLR/CPAL color font.

If creating a new version of the font, you can overwrite the
Web-TT folder, but I suggest retaining the existing versions of
ANBG-font.css and ANBG-font.html
